The N-Puzzle involves the rearranging of a set numbered
tiles within a square grid to reach a disired goal state.
Analyzing the performace of BFS, DLS, and A* search
algorithms we see different strength and weakenss in the
algorithms. I observed that A* explores fewer nodes and ends
up finding shorter solution. BFS and DLS explore the search
space, which is computationally expensive but they ensure
completeness.
